Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches.
standups: frequent short progress update meetings
taskboards: use them to store and track your progress on user stories
sprints: a fixed of time where you set a number of tasks to be completed in the team. After that period is up, your review progress, and set tracks for the next sprint.
meeting minutes: just like the notes in a regular team meeting (including attendees, agenda, discussion points, actions)
pair programming: two programmers, one computer, one keyboard. Take turns to write codes but discuss it as they go
