to effectively work on large projects, we need:
  - version control: tracks changes to our code
  - concurrent programming: multiple people to work on the same files at the same time
Git is a version control tool that enables to people to work concurrently on the same codebase.
Git is a distributed version control software.

Git - Single Machine
Stage 1. version control on a single machine
Getting setup: SSH keys, git clone
Status of work: git status, git log
Doing work: git add, git diff, git commit, git push

Git - Multiple of your machines
Stage 2. version control across multiple of your machines
Multiple machines: git pull, merge conflicts
